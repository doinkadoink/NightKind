# NightKind Collective - Static Website Copy

This is a static copy of the NightKind Collective website (https://nightkind-shadow-market.lovable.app/) downloaded for offline use.

## Files Included

- `index.html` - Main HTML file
- `index-B11PqZaG.js` - JavaScript bundle
- `index-CZEDu5tD.css` - CSS styles
- `fonts.css` - Google Fonts (Creepster and Courier Prime)
- `preview.png` - Website preview image

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
2. The website should display exactly as it appears online
3. All assets are local, so no internet connection is required

## Notes

- This is a static copy, so any dynamic features (forms, backend interactions) will not work
- The website appears to be built with a modern JavaScript framework (likely React/Vue)
- All external dependencies have been downloaded and made local
- The Lovable development badge has been removed for a cleaner appearance
