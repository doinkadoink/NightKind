## Notes

- This is a static copy, so any dynamic features (forms, backend interactions) will not work
- The website appears to be built with a modern JavaScript framework (likely React/Vue)
- All external dependencies have been downloaded and made local
- The Lovable development badge has been removed for a cleaner appearance
- GitHub Pages will automatically serve the website with proper MIME types
